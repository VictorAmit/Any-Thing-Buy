<p>Why Are Facebook Likes Important?
The Like button was introduced in 2009 on Facebook. Since then, it is considered the currency of the social network - people became addicted to likes as a form of social proof, which is a sign of your popularity and importance. Likes also became a key factor for businesses when companies started to flood the network in response to its growing user base. If you want to learn more about Facebook and buy Facebook Likes, then keep on reading.

Facebook (it was "The Facebook" when founded, later 'the' was excluded) has been taking place in our lives since 2004. Since then, its growth has been vast. Even though it has some other competitors in social media like Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. it still holds the title of being the biggest, the most interacted social media platform. One can say Facebook is the pioneer of many innovations on the Internet. So as a brand, it still benefits from 'being the first' in the sector.

Before any other platform, Facebook provided features like sharing news, videos-without time limitations-, creating groups, doing surveys, etc. It is now being used as a mass media like television and newspapers. Having live broadcasts on Facebook is so easy, and you can access millions of users worldwide in seconds. You can even influence political situations in your country. You can see what's happening out there via Facebook. Many political/civil protests got organized from Facebook.

Facebook is vital and has a significant impact on people. Like in other social media platforms, to get likes, followers, comments, and views is the users' primary purpose and determine what you are going to post and show to the public. If you have a Facebook account, you can buy Facebook likes or buy Facebook followers to increase its visibility. 

Facebook is still a growing market for those who want to promote its social media value and credibility. In this situation, social media users must be popular on Facebook, just like on Instagram. If you want to keep your account private but also aim to increase your sales or brand recognition, you need to get a Facebook page with lots of likes and followers. For that purpose, our Facebook page followers and Facebook page likes services are popular with both businesses and individuals that want to work on their self-branding on Facebook.

When it comes to buying Facebook likes, many people ask: is it illegal to buy Facebook likes? Although it may sound like it, it is not illegal, and there is no penalty for it.

What Is the Difference Between Real and Bot Likes?
When you enter our web page, you will see different options. These options are "Regular" and "Real." You need to decide if you want to get real likes or bot likes. Real likes are obtained from real Facebook users. While you get real likes, not only will you increase likes, but more people will also see your posts (and if they like what they see, they can leave a like and comment too!), which will increase your popularity.

Bot likes are obtained from realistic-looking users. They might not be real, but your friends will not be able to say so. Our bot services look very realistic and are very hard to distinguish from real ones. If you want to make your post look popular, you can choose this option. The Regular (bot) option is very affordable to get compared to real likes, and you can get much more of them faster since they are generated via software.

What Are the Advantages of Buying Facebook Likes?
Unlike followers, your likes will not decrease over time. Once you buy likes for your posts, they will be there permanently. There are millions of people who use Facebook around the world. It is good to be popular on Facebook as you can earn money. If you do business, you can advertise your product/service to millions of people and improve your business. The more you get likes on Facebook, the more people you reach. </p>
